## 📝 How It Works
1. **Clock Display**: The digital clock updates every second.
2. **Time Selection**: Users can select a time for Wakeup, Lunch, Nap, and Night.
3. **Button Click Event**: When the button is clicked, the selected times are displayed.
4. **Background Change**: If the system's current time matches any selected time, the background image and message change accordingly.
5. **Duplicate Time Validation**: Ensures that no two time slots have the same value.
